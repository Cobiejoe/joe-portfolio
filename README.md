# Joe Cobarrubias — Technical Training Portfolio

Welcome. This portfolio showcases representative work demonstrating my approach to designing and delivering technically informed training programs for both technical and non-technical audiences.

Most of my professional work has been developed for enterprise environments and is proprietary in nature. The materials presented here are intentionally non-proprietary and were created specifically to demonstrate instructional design judgment, technical fluency, and end-to-end ownership of learning solutions.
