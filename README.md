# Training Portfolio (GitHub Pages)

This repository hosts my public portfolio of representative work as a Technical Trainer / Curriculum Developer.

Most of my professional work has been created in enterprise environments and is proprietary. The materials in this repo are intentionally non-proprietary and were created specifically to demonstrate my instructional design judgment, technical fluency, and end-to-end ownership of learning solutions.

## Live Site
The live webpage is available at:
