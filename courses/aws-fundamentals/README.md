# AWS Fundamentals for Non-Technical Stakeholders

## Audience
Business professionals who collaborate with cloud engineering teams but do not write production code (PMs/TPMs, BAs, Ops, Finance partners, and people leaders).

## Learning Goals
By the end of this course, learners will be able to:
- Explain what “cloud computing” is in practical terms
- Describe the purpose of common cloud building blocks (compute, storage, networking)
- Understand (at a high level) what AWS manages vs what a customer/team manages
- Ask better questions about cost, scale, risk, and ownership during technical discussions

## Course Map
- **Lesson 1:** Cloud Concepts You Actually Need  
- **Lesson 2:** How AWS Supports Business Workflows  
- **Knowledge Check:** Scenario-based reinforcement

## Instructional Approach
This course is intentionally documentation-driven and concept-focused. It avoids certification-level depth in favor of practical understanding that enables better collaboration between business and technical teams.
