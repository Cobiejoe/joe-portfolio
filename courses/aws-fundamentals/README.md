# AWS Fundamentals for Non-Technical Stakeholders

This short course is designed to help non-technical business partners engage more effectively in cloud-related discussions without requiring deep technical expertise.

Rather than focusing on individual AWS services, the course emphasizes:
- shared vocabulary,
- high-level mental models,
- and the ability to ask informed questions about cost, reliability, security, and ownership.

The content is intended to be read sequentially, but individual lessons can also be referenced as needed.
