Welcome. This portfolio showcases representative work demonstrating my approach to designing and delivering technically informed training programs for both technical and non-technical audiences.

Most of my professional work has been developed for enterprise environments and is proprietary in nature. The materials presented here are intentionally non-proprietary and were created specifically to demonstrate instructional design judgment, technical fluency, and end-to-end ownership of learning solutions.

## How to review this portfolio

This portfolio is organized to reflect how technical training and enablement materials are often designed and maintained in real-world environments.

If you’re reviewing this for the first time, the recommended path is:

1. **Start with the course**
   - Review *AWS Fundamentals for Non-Technical Stakeholders* under **Courses**
   - Focuses on lesson structure, clarity of explanation, and alignment to business decision-making

2. **Explore the interactive knowledge check**
   - Located at the end of the course
   - Demonstrates how interactivity can be layered onto documentation-style learning without a full LMS

3. **Read the case study**
   - Explains the design decisions, constraints, and tradeoffs behind the course
   - Provides context on tooling, instructional approach, and use of AI-assisted workflows

4. **Review the lab walkthrough**
   - Shows how technical reasoning and architecture interpretation are taught without requiring hands-on setup

Each artifact is intentionally lightweight, non-proprietary, and designed to demonstrate how I approach instructional design, technical communication, and learning system constraints.
